# PCIbex_AJT
This repository contains the code and data for a demo acceptability judgment experiment hosted on PCIbex ([link to demo](https://farm.pcibex.net/r/glqzxx/)).
The experiment is equipped with the following features:
* Distributing participants evenly among the lists
* Randomizing the trial order within each list
* Displaying contexts before the presentation of a sentence to be evaluated (the button to switch from contexts and the test sentence appears with a 3-second delay to make sure that participants have read the contexts)
* Displaying a question that checks if participants are actually reading the contexts (following some of the trials)
* Language background questionnaire with some of the questions mandatory to answer

## Reference
I adapted JavaScript code from the [Acceptability Judgment Task for PCIbex](https://github.com/a-nap/ajs_pcibex) repository.
